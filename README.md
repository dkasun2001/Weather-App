2. Open the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `bash npm install`
4. Start the development server by running `bash npm run dev`
5. The weather app will be running at http://localhost:5173 in your web browser.

## Project Structure

### The project is structured as follows:

1. src - Contains the React component code for the weather app.
2. components - Contains reusable components for the app.
3. weather.jsx - The main weather component that displays the search bar and weather data.
4. app.jsx - The main app component that renders the weather component.
5. index.css - Styles the entire app.
6. assets - Contains any images or icons used in the app.
7. package.json - Contains project dependencies and scripts.

## Explanation

The weather.jsx component creates the search bar and displays the weather data. It fetches weather data from the Open Weather Map API using an API key stored in an environment variable. The app.jsx component renders the weather.jsx component.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `bash npm install`
3. Start the development server by running `bash npm run dev`
